

Algorithms Used for Rainfall Prediction:
1. Random Forest Regressor – Used as the primary machine learning model for predicting rainfall.
2. Decision Tree Regressor – Another tree-based model that might have been tested for comparison.
3. Linear Regression – A simple regression model used in some parts of the analysis.
4. Polynomial Regression  – Used for fitting non-linear relationships between features and rainfall.
5. Gradient Boosting Regressor – An ensemble method used to improve predictive performance.
6. XGBoost Regressor – A powerful boosting algorithm that improves accuracy.

Libraries Used:
1. Pandas – For data loading and preprocessing.
2. NumPy – For numerical computations.
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn – For data visualization.
4. Scikit-Learn (sklearn) – Used for machine learning models, train-test splitting, feature scaling, and performance evaluation.
5. XGBoost – Used for implementing the XGBoost regressor.
6. Flask – Used in `Webinterface.py to create a web-based interface for users to input data and get rainfall predictions.
